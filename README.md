# Game of Life 

A fast, interactive, and fully customizable implementation of Conway’s Game of Life
built using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a high-performance
Canvas renderer. The project includes a clean landing page, detailed preset info,
wrap-mode simulation, adjustable speed and board size, and user-friendly editing tools.


## Features

- Real-time Game of Life simulation  
- Canvas-based renderer for smooth performance  
- Dark/Light theme support (global toggle)  
- Wrap mode (toroidal board) toggle  
- Speed slider (simulation tick rate)  
- Size slider (dynamic board scaling with center-preservation)  
- Click-to-toggle cells, step mode, random generator, clear board  
- Preset loader with classic patterns (Glider, LWSS, Toad, Beacon, Gosper Glider Gun, Acorn, etc.)  
- Landing page with detailed preset descriptions and large thumbnails  
- Pattern thumbnails automatically scale based on preset width  
- Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS  
- Modular architecture with isolated components and hooks

- Toroidal logic for wrap mode

## Run Locally

 1. Clone the project:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NirajPujari/Game_Of_Life
    ```

2. Go to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Game_Of_Life
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

5. Open in browser:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/
    ```

## How the Game Works

Each cell on the grid is either **alive (1)** or **dead (0)**.  
On each generation, the entire grid updates simultaneously following Conway’s rules:

1. **Underpopulation:**  
   A live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies.
2. **Survival:**  
   A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors stays alive.
3. **Overpopulation:**  
   A live cell with more than 3 neighbors dies.
4. **Reproduction:**  
   A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.

With **Wrap Mode** enabled, the grid behaves like a torus (donut shape), so cells that leave  
one edge reappear on the opposite side.


## Controls

| Control         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Run / Pause** | Start or stop the simulation |
| **Step**        | Advance by one generation |
| **Clear**       | Reset the board to all-dead cells |
| **Random**      | Fill the grid with a random distribution |
| **Speed Slider** | Adjust the simulation tick rate |
| **Size Slider**  | Resize the board (pattern stays centered) |
| **Wrap Mode**    | Toggle edge wrapping (toroidal behavior) |
| **Presets Panel** | Load classic patterns centered in the board |
| **Theme Toggle** | Switch between Light / Dark mode |

## Presets Included

- **Glider** – diagonal spaceship  
- **Blinker** – smallest oscillator  
- **Toad** – period-2 oscillator  
- **Beacon** – oscillating block pair  
- **LWSS** – lightweight spaceship  
- **Acorn** – tiny seed that explodes into chaos  
- **Gosper Glider Gun** – produces gliders indefinitely  
- **Random Small Seed** – experimental, unpredictable patterns

Each preset includes:

- A **scaled thumbnail preview**  
- A **detailed description**  
- **Pattern type** (spaceship, oscillator, gun, etc.)  
- **Period or behavior details**  
- **Origin or historical context**
